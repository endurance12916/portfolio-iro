I'm currently working on converting my React ChatApp to ReactNative. It's gonna be awesome to see this app goes live on mobile! 

Just wanted to share the good resources I found while making it (and to keep a list for myself too):
* [ReactNative Express] (http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/) -  a great website to get you started on the basics
* [The ReactNative Homepage](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* [ReactNative Elements](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/) - it's like Bootstrap for React. A lot of cool styles.
* [This Google Blog](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/01/the-beginners-guide-to-react-native-and_84.html) gives a very detailed example of how to implement Firebase to a ReactNative app. It even builds the app from scratch so it's a great read for beginners.
* [This Medium article](https://medium.com/react-native-development/tutorial-build-a-crowdsourced-react-native-travel-app-with-react-navigation-asyncstorage-and-385304f7b431) talks about how to build a crowdsourced react native Travel App with react-navigation, AsyncStorage, and Firebase
* [React Navigation] (https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/navigation-actions)
* [An example app](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/tree/master/examples/ReduxExample) for ReactNative+React Navigation+Redux
