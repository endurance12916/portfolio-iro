I'm writing this post to share my experience in learning & using Redux. I transformed my Bloc-Chat react app to React+Redux with the help of my mentor. It was a great learning experience and worth every second. I hope this post could help answer some questions for beginners like me.

The first challenge for beginners is to understand why you should learn it. Here are some points I gathered through my research and mentor meetings:

* Redux is popular. Your employer probably expects you to know it if you're a ReactJs developer
* Redux is a powerful tool in managing states. It has a centralized state tree that holds all the states in one place. It makes your app easier to manage and debug
* Redux encourages you to breakout components into presentational components and smart components. This way it's easier for your co-worker to collaborate with you - 
  * A web designer can come in and modify your presentational component without messing up your functions
  * A web developer can modify your smart component without changing the appearance of the app
* It's cool to tell other people that you use both React and
 Redux
